# Issue #001: Implement User Authentication System

## Description

Build a complete user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and maintain secure sessions. This system will serve as the foundation for all user-specific functionality in the application.

### Business Context
Jane is a frequent customer who wants to access her personal account information. She needs a secure way to log into the system so she can view her order history, manage her profile, and make purchases with stored payment information.

## Related User Stories

This issue addresses the following user stories:

- **US-001**: As a customer, I want to log into the system securely so that I can access my personal account and data

## Requirements & Supporting Documents

- **project-requirements/main-requirements.md**, section "User Management"
- **database-schemas/user-schema.md**, entities: User, Session
- **ui-designs/auth-wireframes.md**, screens: Login, Register, Forgot Password

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All user stories listed above are fully implemented and testable
- [ ] Login form accepts email/username and password
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error messages
- [ ] Successful login redirects to dashboard or intended page
- [ ] Session management keeps users logged in appropriately
- [ ] Logout functionality clears session data
- [ ] Password requirements are enforced during registration
- [ ] Failed login attempts are rate-limited and logged
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented
- [ ] All authentication endpoints have proper error handling

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Database schema for users and sessions (external)
- Security middleware configuration
- Email service setup (for password reset)

**Blocks:**
- Issue-002: Order history implementation
- Issue-003: User profile management

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Security Requirements
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (minimum 12 rounds)
- Implement JWT tokens or secure session cookies
- Include CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Rate limiting: max 5 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes

### API Endpoints to Implement
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation

### Stubbing & Mocks
If dependencies are not ready, use these mocks:
- Mock user data as defined in user-stories
- Mock email service with console logging
- Use in-memory session store for development

### Branch & PR Instructions
- **Branch**: `feature/issue-001-user-authentication`
- **PR Target**: `dev`
- **Testing**: Include unit tests for all auth functions and integration tests for API endpoints
- **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new endpoints

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Password hashing and validation
- Token generation and verification
- Input validation and sanitization

### Integration Tests
- Login/logout flow
- Session persistence across requests
- Rate limiting functionality
- CSRF protection

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Valid login works correctly
- [ ] Invalid credentials show error
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Logout clears session properly
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

## Additional Notes

This is a foundational feature that many other parts of the system depend on. Priority should be given to security and reliability over advanced features. Consider implementing basic functionality first, then adding enhancements like "remember me" or social login in future sprints.

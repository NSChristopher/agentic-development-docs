# User Story Template

Use this template to create individual, modular user stories for your project.

## Story Format

**As a** customer  
**I want** to log into the system securely  
**So that** I can access my personal account and data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a registered user, when they enter valid credentials, then they should be logged in successfully
- [ ] Given invalid credentials, when a user attempts to login, then they should see an error message  
- [ ] Given a successful login, when the user navigates to protected pages, then they should have access
- [ ] The login form must include email/username and password fields
- [ ] The system must validate credentials against the database
- [ ] Failed login attempts should be logged for security purposes

## Technical Notes

- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- Implement session management or JWT tokens
- Include CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for failed attempts

## Dependencies

- Database schema for user accounts must be implemented
- Password hashing utility functions
- Session/token management system

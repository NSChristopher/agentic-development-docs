# Project Requirements Overview

This section contains project requirements documents that define the scope, objectives, and success criteria for projects.

## What Goes Here

- **Project Requirements Documents**: High-level project definitions
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: Business needs and expectations
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability constraints

## Creating New Requirements

Use the CMS to create new project requirements documents. Each document should:

1. Clearly define the project scope
2. Identify key stakeholders
3. List functional and non-functional requirements
4. Define success criteria
5. Specify what's out of scope

## Templates Available

- [Project Requirements Template](/docs/templates/project-requirements-template)

## Best Practices

- Keep requirements specific and measurable
- Link requirements to user stories when applicable
- Review and update requirements regularly
- Get stakeholder approval before implementation
- Version control requirements changes

## Team Information

### Team Members
- **Scrum Master:** Charlie
- **Product Owner:** Product Team
- **Developers:** Alice (Backend), Bob (Frontend), Charlie (Full-stack)

### Sprint Capacity
- **Total Story Points Committed:** 8
- **Team Velocity (from previous sprints):** 10 points
- **Available Hours:** 120 hours (3 developers Ã— 40 hours)
- **Capacity Buffer:** 20% for unexpected issues

## Key Documents

Reference these documents during the sprint:
- **project-requirements/main-requirements.md** - Project vision and user management requirements
- **database-schemas/user-schema.md** - User and session data structure
- **ui-designs/auth-wireframes.md** - Login and registration UI designs
- **ui-designs/dashboard-wireframes.md** - User dashboard and order history layouts

## Sprint Planning Notes

### Decision Rationale
- **Why these stories were selected:** Authentication is a prerequisite for all user-specific features. Order history is a high-value feature that customers frequently request.
- **Dependencies identified:** 
  - Issue-002 depends on Issue-001 completion
  - Database schema must be finalized before authentication implementation
  - UI designs should be approved before frontend development begins

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** Database schema changes might require authentication rework
  - **Mitigation:** Finalize schema in first 2 days of sprint
- **Risk:** Third-party authentication service integration complexity
  - **Mitigation:** Start with simple email/password auth, add social login later
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
  - **Mitigation:** Code review with security focus, penetration testing

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (minimum 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Security review completed for authentication features

# User Story Template

Use this template to create individual, modular user stories for your project.

## Story Format

**As a** [user role]  
**I want** [goal/desire]  
**So that** [benefit/value]

## Example

**As a** customer  
**I want** to view my order history  
**So that** I can track my purchases and reorder items easily

## Fields Guide

- **Story ID**: Use a 3-digit number (e.g., 001, 002)
- **User Role**: Who is the user? (customer, admin, visitor, etc.)
- **User Goal**: What does the user want to accomplish?
- **User Benefit**: Why is this valuable to the user?
- **Priority**: How important is this story? (high, medium, low)
- **Story Points**: Estimation for complexity (optional)
- **Epic**: Group related stories under a common theme
- **Acceptance Criteria**: List specific conditions that must be met

## Acceptance Criteria Format

- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] The feature must handle [edge case]
- [ ] The UI must display [specific elements]

## Best Practices

1. **Keep stories small** - Each story should be completable in a sprint
2. **Focus on user value** - Always explain the "why"
3. **Make it testable** - Acceptance criteria should be verifiable
4. **Independent** - Stories should not depend heavily on other stories
5. **Negotiable** - Details can be discussed and refined

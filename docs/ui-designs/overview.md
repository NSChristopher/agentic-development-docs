# UI Designs Overview

This section contains user interface design documentation including wireframes, mockups, and design specifications.

## What Goes Here

- **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity page layouts and navigation
- **Mockups**: High-fidelity visual designs
- **Prototypes**: Interactive design demonstrations
- **Style Guides**: Design system documentation
- **User Flows**: Navigation and interaction patterns

## Creating New Designs

Use the CMS to create new UI design documents. Each document should:

1. Specify the design type (wireframe, mockup, prototype)
2. Include visual assets and design files
3. Link to related user stories
4. Document interaction patterns
5. Specify responsive behavior

## Templates Available

- [UI Wireframes Template](/docs/templates/ui-wireframes-template)

## Best Practices

- Start with wireframes before detailed mockups
- Consider mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistency with design system
- Include accessibility considerations
- Document user interaction flows
- Link designs to user stories and requirements
